Expensica is a comprehensive personal finance tracker designed specifically for Obsidian users. It allows you to effortlessly manage your daily income and expenses with unparalleled speed and privacy. 

By leveraging the power of Obsidian, Expensica ensures that all your financial data is stored locally in a simple JSON file, making it not only fast but also secure and easily portable.

## The Problem

Most expense tracking tools are slow, complex, and invasive. They make you wait for pages to load, force you to connect your bank accounts, and store your financial data on their servers. They're built for accountants, not humans.

## The Solution

Expensica is different. It's built on Obsidian, which means it's lightning fast. Your data is stored locally in a simple JSON file. No cloud. No servers. No waiting. Just pure speed and privacy.
